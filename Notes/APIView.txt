-- Rest framework provides an APIView class, which subclasses django's view class.
-- APIView classes are different from reguler View classes in the following way:
    1. Request passed to the handler methods will be REST framework's Request instances, not Django's
       HttpRequest instances.
    2. Handler methods may return REST framework's response, instead of django's HttpResponse. The view 
       will manage content negotiation and setting the correct renderer on the response.
    3. Any APIExceptions will be cought and mediated into appropriate response.
